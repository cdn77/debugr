SQL formatter plugin for Debugr
=====================================================

This is a formatter plugin, which means that when Debugr is creating
a dump file for a given logger, this plugin will be used for any entries
with the `plugin` attribute matching this plugin's ID.

The plugin doesn't have any options and you don't need to install or
configure it yourself as it will be done automatically if it is needed.
